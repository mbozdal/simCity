This research is supported by the Hydrogen Integration for Accelerated Energy Transitions Hub (**HI-ACT**).

The HI-ACT initiative brings together UK researchers, industry, government, and the public to address key challenges in integrating **hydrogen and alternative liquid fuels (HALF)** across sectors and regions. It aims to clarify their roles and value within the broader energy system.
The **HI-ACT Hub** comprises **10 universities** across the UK and over **40 project partners**, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration for research, innovation, and policy.

# üìò Benchmarking Datasets for Hydrogen Energy Systems

This dataset was created through  cyber attacks on a distributed hydrogen energy system. The simulation environment was constructed using real-world data collected from the **Rye Microgrid** [1], which integrates multiple energy assets including photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, battery storage, electrolyzers, fuel cells, and energy consumers. In the simulation, each component communicates independently with a centralized Energy Management System (EMS) using TCP.
The EMS uses this data to manage energy storage, perform grid interaction, and maintain system balance.

The primary aim of this dataset is to support research into Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by providing both clean and manipulated data traces,
 allowing for robust performance benchmarking of anomaly detection algorithms under cyberattack conditions.

## üß™ Attack Scenarios

Each file consists of two distinct phases:

- **First 50%:** Clean (benign) operation
- **Second 50%:** Attack injected

### üß® Attack Types

1. **Scaling Attack**
   - Formula:  
     `x_attack(t) = x(t) √ó (1 + Œ≥)`
   - Example: Œ≥ = 0.1 ‚Üí 10% increase; Œ≥ = -0.1 ‚Üí 10% decrease

2. **Burst Attack**
   - Formula:  
     ```
     x_attack(t) = {
       x(t‚ÇÄ) √ó (1 + Œ≥)   if t ‚àà [t‚ÇÄ, t‚ÇÄ + n)
       x(t)              otherwise
     }
     ```
   - Simulates value freezing/repetition after manipulation

3. **Zeroing Attack**
   - Formula:  
     `x_attack(t) = 0`
   - Emulates sensor failure or signal loss

### üéØ Attack Intensity Levels

- 10%, 20%, 30% (Œ≥ = ¬±0.1, ¬±0.2, ¬±0.3)

### üß≠ Attack Scope

- PV only
- Wind only
- All components (PV + Wind + Load)

### üìÅ File Format

- **Format:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Entries:** Time-series data for each timestep
- **Total Files:** 30

### üî§ File Naming Convention
The naming convention encodes information about the presence of control logic, attack scope, type, and intensity. The files are categorized as follows:

`attack_<scope>_<attack_type>_<intensity>.csv` (Without Control Logic Implementation)

`action_data_attack_<scope>_<attack_type>_<intensity>.csv` (With Control Logic Implementation)

#### üìå Examples

- `baseline.csv`  
  *(Clean scenario without control logic)*

- `action_data_baseline.csv`  
  *(Clean scenario with control logic)*
  
- `attack_consumption_burst_10.csv`  
  *(Attack targeting consumption using a burst pattern, intensity level 10; no control logic)*

- `action_data_attack_consumption_burst_10.csv`  
  *(Same attack with control logic enabled)*

- `attack_wind_production_zeroing_10.csv`  
  *(Zeroing attack on wind production at intensity level 10)*
